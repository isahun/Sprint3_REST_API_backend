## 📦 Installation & Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### 1. Clone the repository
Open your terminal and run:

git clone <your-repository-url>

### 2. Enter the project folder
**Note on Ambiguity:** Depending on how you cloned the repo (e.g., via VS Code interface), you might already be inside the correct folder.
**Check**: If you see the src folder and package.json in your sidebar, skip this step. Otherwise, run: 

cd book-api

### 3. Install dependenciesThis will download all necessary libraries (NestJS, Mongoose, etc.): npm install

### 4. Set up Environment Variables
The .env file is excluded from Git for security. You must create a new one in the root folder:
#### - Create a file named .env.
#### - Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string: 

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/book-api
PORT=3000

### 5. Launch the Server
#Watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run start:dev

### API Documentation (Swagger) 
Once the server is running, explore and test the API directly from your browser: 
http://localhost:3000/api-docs🛣️
